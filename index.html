Concealer is used only where needed — for dark circles, blemishes, or redness — blended seamlessly for a skin-like finish.  Eyes are kept simple with neutral eyeshadow (or none at all), well-groomed brows, a touch of mascara, and maybe a nude kajal if needed. Lips are done with nude lipstick, tinted balm, or soft gloss, and a natural blush or cream tint is added for a healthy glow — creating an effortlessly clean, fresh look.",
